  <p> The purpose of PaN-learning is to provide open source neutron, photon and muon science training to European scientists and students. 
  <h2>Funding</h2>
  <p>The current funding for the project is provided by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under under grant agreement <a href=" https://www.panosc.eu/" >No. 823852</a>. </p>
  <p>Earlier funding for the project were provided by the European Union’s 7th Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under the <a href="https://www.nmi3.eu/">NMI3-II Grant number 283883</a> and from the European Union’s SINE 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement <a href="https://www.sine2020.eu/">No. 654000</a>. </p>
  <p>We are also grateful for the financial support recieved from the University of Copenhagen via the “Good Education” and “Education 2016” programmes and from Interreg IV via the ÖMIC programme. </p>

  <h2> History </h2>
  <p>PaN-learning started out as e-neutrons.org. It was developed primarily by Copenhagen University as a means to teach their own students about neutrons science. The first courses, namely <a href="https://pan-learning.org/moodle/course/view.php?id=5">Introduction to neutron scattering</a> and <a href="https://pan-learning.org/moodle/course/view.php?id=4">Advanced topics in neutron scattering</a>, were developed by <a href="https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/78483">Associate Professor Linda Udby</a> and were based on both her own and <a href="https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/30116">Professor Kim Lefman's</a> lecture courses. Managaing the moodle platform and McStas integration was championed by <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/peter-kj%C3%A6r-willendrup">Peter Willendrup,</a> Senior Research Engineer at Technical University of Denmark. Creation of many of the moodle elements within the courses was carried out by <a href="https://www.ind.ku.dk/english/staff-auto-list/?pure=en/persons/348492">Viktor Holm</a>, a research assistant at Copenhagen University.</p> 
  
  <p>The project was then taken over by the EU-funded Photon and Neutron Open Science Cloud (<a href=" https://www.panosc.eu/" >PaNOSC</a>) as part of work package 8. The moodle platform and subsequent Jupyter integration is run on servers at the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Denmark and Sweden. The project is now managed by work package leader, <a href="https://europeanspallationsource.se/profile/thomas-holm-rod">Thomas Holm Rod</a>, Head of the Data Management and Software Center of the ESS.</p>
