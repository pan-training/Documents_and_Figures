  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>PaN-learning evolved out of a previous e-learning platform known as e-neutrons.org, which was developed at University of Copenhagen by Kim Lefman, Linda Udby and Peter Willendrup</p>
  <p>It was then picked up by the PaNOSC and ExPaNDS EU funded projects to become PaN-learning, which opened it up to include photon as well as neutron science.</p>
  <p>The site is now hosted by the European Spallation Source in Sweden and Denmark.</p>


  <h2>Funding</h2>
  <p>The current funding for the project is provided by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under under grant agreement No. 823852. </p>
  <p>Earlier funding for the project were provided by the European Union’s 7th Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under the NMI3-II Grant number 283883 and from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 654000. </p>
  <p>We are also grateful for the financial support recieved from the University of Copenhagen via the “Good Education” and “Education 2016” programmes and from Interreg IV via the ÖMIC programme. </p>
