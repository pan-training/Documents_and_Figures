The Data controller shall respond to the request related to the processing of the personal data of the data subject in writing without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request.

The Data controller shall reject the request for information only for the reasons specified in Article 12 (5) (b) of the GDPR, and this may only be done in writing, with due justification and appropriate information.

\subsection{Right to Correction and Deletion (right to be forgotten):}
Inaccurate data shall be corrected by the Data Controller and shall take steps to delete the processed personal data if the reasons set out in Article 17 of the GDPR exist.

The data subject shall have the right to request the deletion of the personal data concerning him without undue delay and the Data controller shall delete the personal data concerning him without undue delay, in particular if one of the following reasons exists:

\begin{itemize}
    \item personal data are no longer required for the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed;
    \item the data subject withdraws his or her consent and there is no other legal basis for the processing;
    \item the data subject objects to the data processing and there is no overriding legitimate reason for the data processing or the data subject objects to the data processing for the direct acquisition of business;
    \item personal data have been processed unlawfully;
    \item personal data were collected in connection with the provision of information society services to children under the age of 16;
    \item if the Data Controller has disclosed the personal data and the personal data are no longer needed for the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed, it shall be deleted and the data controller shall take reasonable steps, taking into account the available technology and implementation costs, including technical measures to inform the controllers that the data subject has requested the deletion of links to the personal data in question or of a copy or duplicate of such personal data. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Right to restriction of data processing:}
In accordance with Article 18 of the GDPR the data subject has the right to request the Data controller to restrict the data processing if
\begin{itemize}
    \item the data subject disputes the accuracy of the personal data (in this case, the restriction applies to the period of time that allows the Data controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data);
    \item the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the deletion of the data and instead requests that their use be restricted;
    \item the Data controller no longer needs personal data for the purpose of data processing, but the data subject requests it in order to submit, enforce or protect legal claims;
    \item the data processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or the data processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the Data controller or a third party and the data subject has objected to the data processing for these purposes (in this case the restriction takes precedence over the legitimate reasons of the data subject).
\end{itemize}

Restriction of processing means that the Data controller does not process the personal data affected by the restriction, except for storage, or only to the extent to which the data subject has consented, or the Data controller may, in the absence of such consent, handle the data necessary to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or in the overriding public interest of the Union or of a Member State of the European Union.

The data controller shall be released from liability for the damage caused and the obligation to pay damages if he proves that the damage or the violation of the data subject's personal rights was caused by an unavoidable cause outside the scope of data processing. Likewise, it does not compensate for damage if it was caused by the intentional or grossly negligent conduct of the injured party.

\subsection{Right to Legal Remedy:}
